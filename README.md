## **Squid Game!**

Have you watched the TV show named *Squid Game* on Netflix? 
Inspired from the TV show, I have created the **bridge game** that appeared on the show. Hi!

#### For this Project, I have...
- Used **Three.js** to form the scene, and **Cannon.js** as the 3D physics engine to animate the character and the events
- Worked with **Blender** to model the 3D main character, and created **animations** using the Action Editor tool
- Delivered **smooth gameplay** to users by using multiple types of cameras and position methods in **Three.js**

#### Let's look at the game first!
##### Brief overview of the game:
- The game consists of one player, and a bridge with **10 strong** glasses, and **10 fragilent** glasses. 
- To win the game, you will need to jump on 10 strong glasses in a row! :sunglasses:

Below is the starting scene of the game. You can **drag**, **zoom**, or **press shift and drag** to customize your view. :laughing:

To play the game, you simply click on one of the two glasses of the next step. :walking:

When you step onto the weak glass, you are unfortunately dead. :pensive:

You will be able to see the replay of the scene of you falling though! :grin:
